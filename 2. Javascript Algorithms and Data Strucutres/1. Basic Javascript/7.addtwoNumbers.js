/* 
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15

Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.

*/

myVar = 10 + 10;
