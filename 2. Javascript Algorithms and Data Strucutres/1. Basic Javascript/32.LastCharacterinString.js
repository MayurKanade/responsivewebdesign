/*
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the 
string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Example:

var firstName = "Charles";
var lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1]; // lastLetter is "s"

Task:
Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

*/
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1]; // Change this line
