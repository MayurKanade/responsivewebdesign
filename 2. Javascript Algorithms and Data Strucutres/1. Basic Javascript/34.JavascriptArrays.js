/* 
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.
You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, 
end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

Task:
Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).
*/

// Only change code below this line
var myArray = ["peanut butter", 0, "jelly", 1, "bread", 2];
