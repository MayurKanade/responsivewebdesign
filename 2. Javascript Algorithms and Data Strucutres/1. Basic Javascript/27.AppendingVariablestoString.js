/* 
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
// ourStr is now "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"
*/
// Task: Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.

// Change code below this line

var someAdjective = "Intresting skill for everyone!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
