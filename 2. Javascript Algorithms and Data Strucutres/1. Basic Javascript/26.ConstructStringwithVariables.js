/*
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. 
By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string 
you're building.

Example:

var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// ourStr is now "Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?"

Task:
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings 
"My name is " and " and I am well!"
*/

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Mayur";
var myStr;
myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
