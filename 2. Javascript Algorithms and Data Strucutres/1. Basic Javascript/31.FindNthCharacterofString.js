/* 
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Formula : i.e n-1

Example:

var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1]; // secondLetterOfFirstName

Task:
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable 
using bracket notation.

*/
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // answer would be V.
