Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic 
and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. 
On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. 
Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, 
and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.

The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other 
- it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. 
When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. 
They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out 
and create a gray color. 
However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce 
a strong visual contrast.

Note: For all color challenges: Using color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page. 
However, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information 
because users with visual impairments may not understand that content. 
This issue will be covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility challenges.

Task:
Change the background-color property of the blue and yellow classes to their respective colors. 
Notice how the colors look different next to each other than they do compared against 
the white background.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: #ffffff;
  }

  .blue {
    background-color: #0000ff;
  }

  .yellow {
    background-color: #ffff00;
  }

  div {
    display: inline-block;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<div class="blue"></div>
<div class="yellow"></div>
