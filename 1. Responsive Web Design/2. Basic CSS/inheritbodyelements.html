<!--
Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, 
and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.

Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, 
and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.

Task:

Your body element should have the font-family property of monospace.
Your h1 element should inherit the font monospace from your body element.
Your h1 element should inherit the color green from your body element.

-->

<style>
  body {
    color: green;
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
