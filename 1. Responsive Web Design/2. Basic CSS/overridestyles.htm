<!--

Task:
Create an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element the color blue. 
Make sure it's below your pink-text class declaration.

Apply the blue-text class to your h1 element in addition to your pink-text class, 
and let's see which one wins.

Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:
-->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }

  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<!--
    We just proved that browsers read CSS from top to bottom in order of their declaration.
    That means that, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.
-->

<h1 class="blue-text pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
