<!--
We just proved that browsers read CSS from top to bottom in order of their declaration. 
That means that, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last. 
Notice that if we even had put blue-text before pink-text in our h1 element's classes, 
it would still look at the declaration order and not the order of their use!

But we're not done yet. There are other ways that you can override CSS. 
Do you remember id attributes?

Let's override your pink-text and blue-text classes, and make your h1 element orange, 
by giving the h1 element an id and then styling that id.

Note: It doesn't matter whether you declare this CSS above or below pink-text class, 
      since id attribute will always take precedence.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }

  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>
