<!--
HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content 
in your markup. 
Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible 
to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. 
This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. 
This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. 
This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, 
its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

example:
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>

Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. 
It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or 
auditory impairments can access it. 
Generally, a web developer is not responsible
for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.

Note: 
The audio clip may sound fast and be difficult to understand, 
but that is a normal speed for screen reader users.
